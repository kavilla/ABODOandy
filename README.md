# ABODOandy

Coding test for ABODO. I was going to do this yesterday (4/12) but my algorithms hw took way longer than expected. So I started this after classes today (4/13).

## Real-world example:
1. Makes an request to fetch data using the example end-point
2. Loads images
3. Displays rental information - bed range, price range, property name
4. Scrolls smoothly -> THIS IS THE PROBLEM, I ran out of time. It's beena little over an hour now. I should be saving the bitmap so the images need to keep mapping out but I also need to work on my AI hw as well.
5. Fits correctly on multiple sized screens - orientation locked like iOS
